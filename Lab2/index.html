      <h4> Pelican Peak (CTF) </h4>
         <section> I was contracted to develop the Capture the Flag map Pelican Peak for the 2023 Team Fortress 2 Summer Update. It took a very long time, and then everyone thought it was mid. </section>

    <h4> Megalo (KOTH)</h4>
    <section> In 2020, I was contracted to develop the King of the Hill map Megalo for the Scream Fortress 2020 Update. It features a central control point that moves up and down, as well as ghost trains that run you over while you desperately try to play the game.</section>
